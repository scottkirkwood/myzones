Things That Need to be Done

- Have edit_names and edit_timezones to actually work
- Be able to set the time to "now", again
- Have a console mode option which spits out the current times on the command line
- Have a iconable window with tool tips for help
- Sort on various things, like TimeZone
- Make it even easier to select a time, maybe a drop down with half hour increments.
